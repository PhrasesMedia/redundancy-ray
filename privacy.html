        <p>
          Redundancy Ray (“the tool”, “we”, “us”) is a simple calculator designed to help Australian
          users estimate redundancy and leave payouts. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
          being transparent about how data is handled.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray does <strong>not</strong> collect or store any of the values you type into the calculator.
          All calculations (salary, years of service, interest rate, etc.) run locally in your browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, we use third-party services that may collect limited information automatically, such as
          device type, browser type, pages visited, and general usage patterns.
        </p>

        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the site. Google Analytics may collect:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device and browser information</li>
          <li>Pages visited and time spent on the site</li>
          <li>Approximate location (based on IP)</li>
          <li>Broad demographic and interest categories (if enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google Analytics does <strong>not</strong> collect the calculator inputs you type into Redundancy Ray.
        </p>

        <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
        <p>
          We display ads via Google AdSense. AdSense may use cookies and similar technologies to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Serve and personalise ads</li>
          <li>Measure ad performance</li>
          <li>Detect and prevent invalid traffic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Affiliate links</h3>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray may include affiliate links (for example, to merchants like Amazon or other partners).
          When you click an affiliate link, the affiliate network may track that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You visited from Redundancy Ray</li>
          <li>Whether a purchase or action was completed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We receive anonymous reporting for commissions and do not receive your personal details from
          affiliate networks.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Cookies and tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray itself does not set cookies for the calculator. However:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies.</li>
          <li>Google AdSense uses cookies to display relevant ads.</li>
          <li>Affiliate partners may use cookies after you click an affiliate link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can manage or disable cookies in your browser settings. This may affect how ads or analytics work
          but not the calculator itself.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-party links and sites</h2>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray contains links to external websites (for example, merchants and reference sites).
          We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external sites. We encourage you
          to review their privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray is intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do, the “Last updated” date at the top
          of this page will be revised. Continued use of the tool after changes are published indicates
          acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
