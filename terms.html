          These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of Redundancy Ray (“the tool”, “we”, “us”).
          By accessing or using the tool, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of the tool</h2>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray is provided as a general information and estimation tool for Australian users.
          It is designed to help you understand potential redundancy and leave payouts in a simple,
          approximate way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Redundancy Ray is <strong>not</strong>:

          <li>Tax advice</li>
          <li>A substitute for professional consultation or official calculations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. No guarantee of accuracy</h2>
        <p>
          While we aim to keep the information and calculations reasonably up to date, we do not guarantee
          that the outputs are accurate, complete, or suitable for your particular situation.
        </p>
        <p>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. No professional relationship</h2>
        <p>
          Use of Redundancy Ray does not create a financial, legal, or tax adviser relationship between you and
          Phrases Media. You should seek independent advice from a qualified professional before making decisions
          based on the tool’s outputs.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Limitation of liability</h2>

          Redundancy Ray may display advertising (for example, via Google AdSense) and may include affiliate links
          to third-party products or services. We may earn a commission when you click or purchase through
          those links.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advertising and affiliate relationships do not influence the calculator logic or the estimates that the
          tool provides.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tool may also contain links to external websites. We do not control, endorse, or accept responsibility
          for the content, products, or services offered on those sites.
